# Windows NT Malware Development Kit (MDK) - Focused Replication

This project is a replication of the original [Windows Malware Development Kit (MDK)](https://github.com/damariion/win-mdk) framework, **but solely focused on kernel-mode operations**. While the original MDK demonstrates user-mode process manipulation, memory handling, hashing, and registry interaction, this version narrows down the scope to the kernel side.
